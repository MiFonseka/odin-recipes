        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally,
                until
                tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. <br> Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water when draining; set
                aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook for 2 minutes,
                undisturbed. <br> Add in snap peas and stir until shrimp are just becoming opaque. <br>Stir in pesto and
                cooked pasta until well combined.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of lemon zest and the juice of the lemon to the pasta and toss to combine. <br>Add pasta
                water as needed to achieve desired consistency. Serve immediately.</li>
